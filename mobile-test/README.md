- Install Flutter and env tool for your OS as per instructions on the Flutter site
- Setup your editor as per Flutter doc
- Test your setup by running Flutter doctor
​
## Run the project
​
- Run `flutter pub get`
- Run `flutter run` or from vscode `fn + f5`
​
### Trap list

- The cmd flutter is not working: your flutter sdk path is not exported or is not the good one
- Your app doesn't work well: clean your build cache with `flutter clean`
- Something went wrong with your XCode or iOS simulator:
  - Your XCode or simulator is not up to date
  - On XCode, check your provisioning profile, it should be `none`
  - On XCode, check your signing bundle identifier, it should be `ai.aerial.rca`
​
## Let's start
​
- You have one hour to finish the tasks below
- Don't worry if everything is not complete at the end
- Before starting we let you 10 minutes with us to:
  - Provide you an overview of the code
  - Ask any question you have in mind about the code or the exercise
- After this first period of 10 minutes, we will let you work:
  - Google should be your best friend if you have question
  - Feel free to let us know if you are blocked, we will help you
​
Now the rules are defined, let's complete the tasks.
​
## Let's work

​
### Integration
​
1. Header:
​
- The header section must be in the top fixed position
- As shown in the Figma layouts, the header section has two possible states selected by the `isActive` status
- The state should be updated every 5 seconds
- In case of error, just print a relevant debug message in the console
​
2. Cards:
​
- The card list must be scrollable
- Every change of the `isActive` value should trigger a new card that includes the associated timestamp
- The state should be verified every 5 seconds
- In case of error, just print a relevant debug message in the console
